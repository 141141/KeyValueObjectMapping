Introduction
=========================

KeyValueParser is a framework that provides an easy way to deal with any key/value type, as JSON, plist and even a common NSDictionary.

It's made to be used with NSJSONSerialization and other resources, and the main goal is to avoid the tedious work when you need to deal with key/value types.

Usage
-------------------------

KeyValueParser is a simple object, all you need to do is create a new object and start to transform a dictionary to any classes.
